/*
 * Piece.java
 * A Piece object represents a chess piece in the game. Pieces
 * have a PieceType, Color and a list of MoveTypeAndConstraints
 * objects (for each type of Move that a Piece can make, there is 
 * a list of Constraint objects used to prevent that piece from 
 * making and invalid move). A Piece also keeps track of whether 
 * or not it has been moved away from it's original position.
 * Piece implements the PieceSubject and PieceObserver interfaces
 * to assit in keeping a piece from moving into check. When ever 
 * a Piece object is "moved," it notifies the king(s)
 * (notifyKingObservers()) which returns if that king has been
 * placed in check by this move. Each king of this piece's own 
 * color should be registered/unregistered through the course of
 * the game to insure appropriate functionality.
